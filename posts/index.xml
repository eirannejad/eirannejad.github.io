            <description>I wish I could see myself from outside of this body; as a third observer. A lot of times I think I&amp;rsquo;m right. But the reactions I get, tell a different story. I care so much about things that aren&amp;rsquo;t that important to others. I think the survival formula that I follow has different constants applied, compared to the norm. Most probably it has a deep psychological reason.
Maybe it would be better if I could attach a debugger to myself.</description>

<p>Maybe it would be better if I could attach a debugger to myself. Maybe even a serial TTY would be enough so I can see the log messages spitted out from my brain. I would spend the rest of my days figuring out why I think or react the way I do.</p>
