      <description>I am not liked, and not very popular among most human beings. I wish I could take my backpack and books and blast off to another planet; Keeping to search, to love, to laugh, to learn, to explore, etc.</description>

      <description>You feel pain. It is not physical. Physical pain is easy. It is external. You cut the cords; it frees you from the pain and lets you focus on the fix. Psychological pain is different. It is internal. There are no cords to cut.
The pain is from a fire inside you. When it is consistently fed stuff to burn, it is ok. But when it runs out of fuel, it starts burning You.</description>

      <description>I wish I could see myself from outside of this body; as a third observer. A lot of times I think I’m right. But the reactions I get, tell a different story. I care so much about things that aren’t that important to others. I think the survival formula that I follow has different constants applied, compared to the norm. Most probably it has a deep psychological reason.
Maybe it would be better if I could attach a debugger to myself.</description>
